NAME
    Number::Rangify - Optimize a list of values into ranges

VERSION
    version 1.100860

SYNOPSIS
        use Number::Rangify 'rangify';

        my @list = (1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 9, 10, 11, 15);
        my @ranges = rangify(@list);
        for my $range (@ranges) {
            printf "%s-%s\n", $range->Size;
        }

DESCRIPTION
    This module provides a function that can optimize a list of values into
    range objects.

FUNCTIONS
  rangify
    Takes a list of values and makes them into ranges.

    For example:

        rangify(1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 9, 10, 11, 15);

    returns the following ranges:

        1-3
        5-5
        7-7
        9-11
        15-15

    It returns a list (in list context) or an array reference (in scalar
    context) of Set::IntRange objects.

    Duplicate values in the input list are ignored.
